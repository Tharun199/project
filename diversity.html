    <p>We work to bring out the best in our students, faculty and staff by valuing their unique backgrounds, experiences and perspectives&ndash;welcoming and leveraging individual contributions to collaborate, create, innovate and compete in a global society. We address issues of discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct and retaliation so members of our community can work, learn, grow and thrive in a safe and supportive environment. Ultimately, we aspire toward inclusive excellence by leading with courage and compassion, treating everyone with dignity and respect, and enhancing the quality of life for everyone with whom we connect.&nbsp;</p>
