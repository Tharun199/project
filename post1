<p>The University of Cincinnati is committing $12 million to grow inclusive excellence by leveraging diverse perspectives to advance innovation, creativity and complex problem solving in biomedical research. The new program, Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST<sup>+</sup>) Lives Here for Urban Health, aligns with the National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s FIRST Program and advances the university&rsquo;s Next Lives Here strategic direction.</p>
<p>The FIRST<sup>+</sup> Lives Here for Urban Health program seeks to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Expand leadership and faculty development initiatives to cultivate sustainable culture change that promotes inclusive excellence at UC</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Recruit and invest in a diverse group of early-stage investigators and strengthen recruitment and retention strategies related to inclusive excellence</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Advance career success and satisfaction of diverse faculty through professional development, mentorship and community-building</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>This important initiative directly aligns with our Next Lives Here strategic direction &mdash; spanning the Academic Excellence, Urban Impact, and Innovation Agenda platforms. Our investment builds upon a foundation of work around inclusive excellence. Success within our &lsquo;First+ Lives Here for Urban Health&rsquo; program will help our academic community better represent the rich diversity found within our local community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;UC President Neville G. Pinto.</p>
<p>As part of the FIRST<sup>+</sup> program commitment, which includes financial support from the <em>Next Lives Here</em> Research2030 program, Office of the Provost, College of Medicine and College of Arts &amp; Sciences, nearly $9.5 million will support the hiring of a diverse group of six new FIRST<sup>+</sup> faculty over a five-year period at the assistant professor tenure-track level. Remaining funds will be used for FIRST<sup>+</sup> programming related to faculty development, inclusive community building and practice changes, and evaluation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strategic collaboration and allocation of resources to create the FIRST<sup>+</sup> program clearly illustrates the university&rsquo;s commitment to transformation and inclusion,&rdquo; says Valerio Ferme, PhD, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost. &ldquo;By increasing the diversity of early-stage investigators in the sciences, youth within our community will be able to see that they too can pursue a future in academia creating a clear pathway for their future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New hires within the FIRST<sup>+</sup> program will be within the neuroscience, cancer and biomedical informatics scientific clusters, which span multiple UC colleges including the College of Medicine and College of Arts &amp; Sciences. FIRST<sup>+</sup> faculty with data science and/or biomedical informatics research programs will also be supported within the Office of Research&rsquo;s newly opened state-of-the-art UC Digital Futures building located in the Cincinnati Innovation District.</p>
<p>The university has also applied for over $10 million through the National Institutes of Health to further these initiatives, including an increased investment in programming and an expansion of the FIRST<sup>+</sup> cohort with six additional faculty hires. If awarded, the NIH grant will boost UC&rsquo;s financial commitment to $22 million toward growing a culture of inclusive excellence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By promoting inclusive practices, we can enhance research and innovation at UC,&rdquo; says Pat Limbach, PhD, vice president for research at UC. &ldquo;Increasing our diversity strengthens the quality of research at UC to further our mission as an urban public research institution.&rdquo;</p>
